Clock Gating
Test Case: Ensure that unused portions of the chip (e.g., unused cores or blocks) are successfully disabled using clock gating techniques.
Purpose: Checks if the chip can reduce power consumption by turning off clocks to unused areas, ensuring that power is only consumed by active components.
