Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS)
Test Case: Test the functionality of DVFS, where the voltage and frequency of the chip are dynamically adjusted based on workload requirements.
Purpose: Verifies that the chip adjusts power settings properly based on workload, minimizing energy consumption during low activity periods.
