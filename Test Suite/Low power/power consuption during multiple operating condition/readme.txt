Power Consumption During Multiple Operating Conditions
Test Case: Test the chip under different operating conditions such as varying temperature, voltage, and frequency to assess its power consumption across a range of environments.
Purpose: Ensures that the SoC can handle environmental variations without exceeding power consumption limits.
