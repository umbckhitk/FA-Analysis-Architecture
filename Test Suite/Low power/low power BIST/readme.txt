Low-Power Built-In Self-Test (BIST)
Test Case: Test the chip's built-in self-test (BIST) functionality under low-power conditions, ensuring the test patterns and responses are generated efficiently.
Purpose: Verifies that the SoC can perform self-testing while maintaining minimal power consumption.
