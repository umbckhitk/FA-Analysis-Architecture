Endurance and Write-Verify Tests
Test Case: Test the endurance of the memory by repeatedly writing and verifying data over a long period.
Test Description: Write and verify data to memory cells repeatedly (e.g., thousands or millions of times) to simulate long-term usage and check for wear-out or degradation in the memory.
Expected Result: Memory should maintain correct functionality even after extensive write cycles.
