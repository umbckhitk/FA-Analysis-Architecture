Data Retention and Stability
Test Case: Test if the data in memory is retained correctly after power cycles or resets.
Test Description: Write a set of data to the memory, cycle the power or reset the system, and verify that the data is still intact.
Expected Result: Data should be retained across power cycles if it is non-volatile memory, or after a reset if it is volatile memory with appropriate refresh mechanisms.
