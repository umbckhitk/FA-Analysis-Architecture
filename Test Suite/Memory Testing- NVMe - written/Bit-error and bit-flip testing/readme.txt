Bit-Error and Bit-Flip Testing
Test Case: Check for bit errors, where a bit in the memory unexpectedly flips (e.g., 0 becomes 1 or vice versa).
Test Description: Perform read and write operations with known data values, and check for any flipped or corrupted bits.
Expected Result: No bit errors should occur, and the data read should match the data written.
