Shift Register Test:
This involves testing the shift register functionality of the boundary scan cells. In this test, data is shifted through the boundary scan chain to detect any faults in the shift registers or the data path between them.

Test Case: Verify data integrity by shifting a known pattern through the boundary scan cells and checking the expected output.
