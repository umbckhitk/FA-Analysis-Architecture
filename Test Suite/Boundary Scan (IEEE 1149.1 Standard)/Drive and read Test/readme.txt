Drive and Read Test (Boundary Scan I/O Testing):
This involves testing the boundary scan pins by driving signals to them and reading the response, allowing the tester to detect any discrepancies in the behavior of the I/O pins.

Test Case: Drive specific values to the I/O pins through the boundary scan chain and verify the expected values on the corresponding input pins.
