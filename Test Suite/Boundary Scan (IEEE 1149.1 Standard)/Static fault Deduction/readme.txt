Static Fault Detection (Stuck-at Fault Testing):
This test detects faults where a pin or node is stuck at a fixed logic level (either 0 or 1) instead of toggling as expected. This is typically used for both input and output pins of the boundary scan cell.

Test Case: Check if an output pin is stuck at logic '0' or '1' under normal operating conditions.
