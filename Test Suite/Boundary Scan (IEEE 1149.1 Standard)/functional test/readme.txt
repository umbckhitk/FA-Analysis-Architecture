Functional Test (Behavioral Testing):
This test applies functional patterns to the boundary scan cells to verify the correct operation of the logic in the system. It helps to check the correct functionality of both the device and the interconnections.

Test Case: Apply test patterns that exercise the chip's functional paths (using the boundary scan path) and ensure that the outputs match expected results.
