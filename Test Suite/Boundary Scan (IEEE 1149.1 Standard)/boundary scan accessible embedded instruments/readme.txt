Boundary-Scan-Accessible Embedded Instruments (IEEE P1687):
This test involves accessing embedded instruments or additional test resources (e.g., sensors, analog components) that are connected via the boundary scan path. It allows the tester to verify embedded systems' operation.

Test Case: Access embedded instruments via the boundary scan interface and verify their functionality.
