BIST (Built-In Self-Test) Integration:
Some SoCs integrate BIST circuitry that can be controlled and monitored via boundary scan. Test cases could include enabling BIST features through boundary scan to initiate self-testing of certain logic blocks.
Test Case: Enable BIST through the boundary scan interface and analyze the results.
