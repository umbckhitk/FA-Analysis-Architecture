JTAG Chain Test:
Boundary scan can be used to test the JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) chain of devices connected in series. This test verifies that all devices in the chain are responsive and that there are no issues in the chain's configuration.

Test Case: Check the integrity and responsiveness of the JTAG chain by accessing each device in the chain.
