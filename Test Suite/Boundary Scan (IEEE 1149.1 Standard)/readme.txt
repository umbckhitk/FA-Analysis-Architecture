Interconnect Test (Connectivity Test):
The basic function of boundary scan is to test the interconnections between pins on the chip and between chips on the PCB (Printed Circuit Board). The test checks for open circuits (where a connection is missing) and short circuits (where two pins are incorrectly connected).

Test Case: Test for shorts or opens between boundary scan pins and adjacent components.
