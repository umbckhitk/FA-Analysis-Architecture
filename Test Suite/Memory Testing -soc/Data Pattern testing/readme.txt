Data Pattern Testing
Test Case: Test memory with various data patterns (e.g., all 0s, all 1s, alternating 0s and 1s, etc.).
Test Description: Write and verify different patterns (e.g., 0x00, 0xFF, 0xAA, 0x55) to memory locations to check for any pattern-specific issues, such as bit flipping or retention errors.
Expected Result: All patterns should be written and read back correctly without any corruption or errors.
